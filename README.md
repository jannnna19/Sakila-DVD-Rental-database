**In this project, I will write queries for the following questions:**
- Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.
- Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. 
- find a list of  movies, types, and description where the movie length was more than 60 minutes
- find each actor who has made the maximum number of movies with a PG-13 rating

*THANK YOU!*
